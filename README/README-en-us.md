# Clock Drawing Test

A [Clock Drawing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_dysfunction#Clock_drawing_test)
scoring system implemented with Python 3 (3.7.0).

## Dependencies

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/):

`pip install opencv-python`

`pip install numpy`

Make sure you can run the following statements in your Python 3 shell:

### Virtual Environment

You might definitely want to use virtual environment during development. My personal recommendation would be [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv).
